It has a little of everything, so if you realy wanted to check out that Simpsons T-shirt but don't want to walk all the way back to the Simpsons' area, check out this place.

                                        This meet and greet spot is just nect to the Studio Sweet shop. Here you'll be able to meet a few familure faces, however we inthe reporting room rarly see this spot open for characters. According to the Universal Studios website, you'll be able to see characters such as Woody Woodpecker, Scooby-do, and some of the Simpsons characters. However, we've found that you'll have better luck meeting these charcters elsewhere.

You'll get to meet new characters and the music on this ride is sure to get stuck in your head! However, this ride may not be for everyone. Keep in mind that this ride does have external special effects like fog and there will be flashing lights. This may be scarry for some younger riders. Speaking of riding, this dark ride offers a very unquie ride veichle. Jus tlike in the movie, you'll be riding bikes! This gives a very open feel to the ride, like your acctually with E.T. and friends!
