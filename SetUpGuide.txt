12/17/2024, The following is what I'll be setting up first. It'll be the ground work for the project.

The first page:MainPage.html
    The set up: The navigation will feater two pictures, which will act as links.
        The first picture will be of Islands of Adventure and the Secound will be of Universal Stuidos.
        Under the nav, which will be in the middle of the page, will be a few comments from our reporters.

The Universal Page: UniversalSide.html
    The set up: The nav will be moved towards the top of the page and will be smaller. This page will then have a nav to the side
    for differnt aspects of the park's experinces. These will include parades, meet and greets, food, cleanliness, and rides.
    Near the bottum of the main page will be our thoughts and feelings of the Universal side over all.
    These pages will be kept in their own folder for up-keep while programming.

The Islands of Adventure Page: IOAside.html
    The set up: It'll be a near copy of the UniversalSide.html with the same nav set ups. The forulaic set up is to
    help user interaction with the site.
